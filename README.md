Handbook containing methods and models used in statistical analyses and modelling, machine learning, and data science in general.

Statistics:
* p-value, type I/II errors, power
* common tests: one-sample t-test, pooled t-test, chi-square test
* GAMM
* GLMM
* Likelihood Ratio Test

Machine Learning:
* Discriminant classifiers (Least Squares, Fisher's Linear, Gaussian Quadratic,
* Decision Trees, Forests
* Gradient Boosting

Feature Engineering:
* Splines

General:
* Regularization (L1, L2, Elasticnet)
* Evaluate a classification model (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve etc.)
* Evaluate a regression/forecasting model (MSE, R2, MAPE etc.)
* Cross-validation (cross-sectional/TS), Bias-Variance Decomp.
